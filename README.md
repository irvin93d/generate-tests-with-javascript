# Generate tests with Javascript

This repo contains examples of how you can use quickcheck (the JS library is called fast-check)
to generate random data to test your code.

## Prerequisites

Have node and npm installed. You probably want to have some basic typescript + unit-testing knowledge as well :)

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the test suite in watch mode

```bash
npm test
```

3. Start hacking!
